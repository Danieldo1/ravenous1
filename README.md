# React js project
Here im exploring further more into utelizing Git and  Github knowledge in this off platform project that is curated by Codecademy.

## Ravenous by Codecademy

Is a multi-step tutorial that expects the students to show off their knowledge in creating an interactive app. 
Some skills that are being taken away are:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 -   Javascript
-   React
-   Git and GitHub
-   HTTP Requests and Responses
-   Authentication

### My findings

The project is exciting and brings in a lot of challanges that are thrilling and complex as a novice developer. Yet i have been able to achive them in this project and many more to come !
