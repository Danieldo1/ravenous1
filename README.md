# React js project

Here I'm exploring further into utilizing Git and GitHub knowledge in this off-platform project that is curated by Codecademy.
 **Features**

-   The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
-   Users can  _simulate_  a search by typing in the search bar
-   A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.
  

## Ravenous by Codecademy

  

Is a multi-step tutorial that expects the students to show off their knowledge in creating an interactive app.

Some skills that are being taken away are:

 


- HTML

- CSS

- Javascript

- React

- Git and GitHub

- HTTP Requests and Responses

- Authentication

  

### My findings

  

The project is exciting and brings in a lot of challenges that are thrilling and complex for a novice developer like myself. Yet I have been able to achieve them in this project and many more to come!
